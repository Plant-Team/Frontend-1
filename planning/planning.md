# PLANNING STRATEGY

We started off planning our application in concept, followed by User Stories. Once the User Stories were complete, we were able to follow a RESTful approach to make our proposed ideas fit into CRUD methods.

## Example of Planning Notes:
Backlog
—Wireframes
	—Courtney to Wireframe
		1. App.js
		2. Header Component (Home/Login Buttons)
		3. Logged in header (if login===true)
		4. (Search form for finding plant, when search, populate Profile PAge with Plants)
		5. Landing/About Page
		6. Sign up Model (Already have a profile, login?)
		7. Your Profile Page/With your plants
	

Step 1

—Frontend
	—Create a boilerplate react app
	—Attach the react app to Git Repo (inside of our collection)
	—Everyone can clone and create their own branch.
	—Divvy up work
—Backend
	—Create a MongoDB and add http models
Create user
Read user
Update user
Delete user

Create plant
Read plant
Update plant
Delete plant

Step 2

—Frontend
	—Create at least 4 Components
		1. App.js
		2. Header Component (Home/Login Buttons)
		3. Logged in header (if login===true)
		4. (Search form for finding plant, when search, populate Profile PAge with Plants)
		5. Landing/About Page
		6. Sign up Model (Already have a profile, login?)
		7. Your Profile Page/With your plants

# PLANNING STRATEGY
Then we created wireframes. Our wireframes were the guide for the Frontend, and from those we could figure out our components.

## Wireframes
These were the concepts for the site I created in Google Slides.

# PLANNING STRATEGY -- Proposal

We condensed our backlog into an MVP and submitted it as a proposal for Project 3.

# PLANNING STRATEGY -- After Proposal

After our proposal we switched to Jira to place elements of our backlog to create a Sprint for the project's MVP. Our MVP was what we described in our proposal.

Our Backend was the first thing to tackle. Followed by the front, and ensuring that authorization worked required working on both at the same time. Every morning we held a scrum to plan what we would accomplish for the day. We each volunteered different elements to work on, but always towards MVP, until MVP was complete, when we each could add a stretch goal to the backlog to work on.
